// (audio samples, video files, images) - see ArrangeMediaImport.cpp for the
// worker-thread implementation. Mirrors SampleScanner's plain-std::thread /
// mutex-guarded-result / main-thread try_lock-poll pattern (SampleScanner.h):
// decode has no real-time constraints and never touches ImGui, GL, or the
// audio graph, so it is safe on a worker thread. Unlike SampleScanner (one
// reused thread, one scan at a time), each import job gets its own detached
// thread, since dropping several files at once should decode them
// concurrently rather than queue behind each other.
