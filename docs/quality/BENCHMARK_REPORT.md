# Infinite v0.6.0 — Benchmark Report

Source: `docs/quality/SCOREBOARD.md` (rows dated 2026-10-12 to 2026-10-14) and `bench/baselines/m2-8gb.jsonl`.
Machine: base MacBook Air M2, 8 GB (Mac14,7). No data from Windows or Linux.
Scope: this is what was measured. Competitor numbers exist only where listed in §2–§4; everything else is Infinite against its own targets.

## 1. Summary

| Pillar | Metrics | Met | Behind | Info only | Unmeasured |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 Live AV workstation | 10 | 9 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| P5 Audio quality and hosting | 36 | 28 | 0 | 8 | 0 |
| P6 Timeline and arrangement | 2 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| P7 3D, compositing, output | 10 | 9 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| P8 Performance | 39 | 18 | 2 | 7 | 12 |

Known misses: 10,000-instance scene cost (§4), the heaviest projector scene (§5), and three recorded exceptions (effect insert gain, stretch crest, geometry winding).

## 2. Audio: Infinite vs other synths (black-box MIDI → audio, same harness)

| Metric | Analog | Wavetable | Vital | Serum 2 | Diva |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Worst pitch error, MIDI 24–108 (cents, lower better) | 0.173 | 0.174 | 0.174 | 0.174 | 7.73 |
| Non-harmonic energy, MIDI 60 (dB, lower better) | -84.51 | -84.16 | -84.34 | -82.96 | -40.80 |
| Non-harmonic energy, MIDI 96 (aliasing) | -83.26 | -84.94 | -84.31 | -82.59 | -27.00 |
| Non-harmonic energy, MIDI 108 (aliasing) | -81.20 | -83.92 | -83.63 | -81.86 | -10.35 |

Reading: pitch accuracy is tied with Vital and Serum 2; aliasing is in the same band as Vital and Serum 2 (Wavetable ahead of Serum 2 at 96/108, Analog slightly behind Vital). Diva's figures reflect its analog-modelled design, not a defect. Attack, release and velocity response are design choices and are reported, not judged.

Infinite CPU per voice (offline, ms of render per second of audio): Wavetable 3.03, Analog 29.94. No competitor CPU figures measured. Analog + EQ track: 68.4 ms/s, about 10 tracks at 70% of one core; Wavetable + Reverb: 18.6 ms/s, about 34 tracks.

Internal audio correctness (all met, release-gated): pitch ≤1 cent across 44.1/48/96 kHz, note on/off clicks ≤12 dB, no stuck voices (tail ≤-100 dBFS), bit-identical repeat renders, mixer sum error ≤1e-6, gain knob error 0 dB.

Plugin hosting: 97.6% of installed VST3 and 97.6% of installed AU plugins load and pass audio headless; 0 unexplained host crashes.

## 3. Audio latency and real-time

| Metric | Result | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Audio callback load p99, 24 voices, 256-frame buffer | 44.75% | ≤50% |
| Xruns at 256 frames | 0 | 0 |
| Effect latency after compensation | 0 ms (AudioFilter 0.19 ms) | informational |

Not a target: 64-frame buffers (the baseline recorded 3 xruns at 64 frames).

## 4. 3D and offline render: Infinite vs Blender

| Metric | Infinite | Blender | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10,000 instances, per frame | 3.08 ms | 1.26 ms | Infinite behind (target ≤1.30) |
| Subdivide ×2 + animated displacement, per frame | 7.19 ms | 8.14 ms | Infinite ahead |
| Cloth 32×32, per frame | 0.42 ms | 18.4 ms | solvers differ (Infinite 6 iterations, Blender 5 quality steps) |
| Movie render fps (blur scene, ProRes 4444) | 170 fps at 720p, 81 at 1080p, 44.5 at 2160p | 1.58 fps at 720p | same scene family, Infinite far faster |
| H264 luma PSNR, blur scenes | 50.6–51.8 dB | 44.3–46.1 dB | Infinite ahead |
| H264 luma PSNR, instanced scenes | 35.5–37.1 dB | 28.8–32.2 dB | Infinite ahead |
| Movie render fps, instanced scenes (ProRes 4444) | 128 (720p), 80 (1080p), 57 (2160p) | 0.88 (720p), 0.66 (1080p), 0.21 (2160p) | Infinite far faster |
| A/V sync offset, 10 min render | 0.042 ms | 0.021 ms | both negligible |
| A/V sync drift, 10 min render | 0 ms/min | 0 ms/min | tied |

Arrangement render of the reference scene: 2.25× realtime; worst A/V drift 0 frames.
Offline movie fps (Infinite): blur 720p H264 263, instanced 720p H264 201, instanced 1080p ~80.

## 5. Live visuals, UI and projector (Infinite only)

| Metric | Result | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Launch to first frame | 342 ms | ≤1000 ms |
| Patch load, 400 nodes | 6.04 ms | ≤16.7 ms |
| Patch save | ≤2.86 ms | ≤16.7 ms |
| Canvas pan p50, 300 nodes | 16.67 ms | ≤17.2 ms |
| Canvas pan p95, 200 nodes | 16.69 ms | ≤22.8 ms |
| Project load, 4000 nodes (headless) | 0.874 s | informational |
| Projector p99 interval under load | 17.64 ms | ≤18.3 ms |
| Missed vsync, standard scenes | 0% | ≤0.5% |
| Input-to-photon | 1 frame | ≤2 frames |
| Peak memory footprint | 760 MB | ≤912 MB |
| Audio-reactive flash latency | 16.6 ms (frame quantisation ~9.6) | ≤45 ms |
| Beat lock / clock lock | 100% / 100% | 100% |
| Sync drift over take | 0 ms/min | ≤1 ms/min |
| Steady-state render-target reallocations | 0 | 0 |
| Stress (fuzz, random patches, kill-during-save) | 0 failures | 0 |
| Media decode (4×2160 clips) | 1.01× clip fps, 0 dropped | ≥1.0×, 0 |

Misses:
- Heaviest projector scene (4×2160 video + 3 windows + camera + Syphon): p99 33 ms and 9.4% missed vsync (targets 18.3 ms / 0.5%). Scenes with 2×1080 and 2–3 windows are at 17.7 ms p99 and 0% missed.

## 6. Not measured yet

- 4000-node canvas pan/select/delete (R5), edit-storm under live load (B3 edit), long soak (B7: memory growth, xruns, thermal), real-time audio-reactive 10,000-instance scene (live.frame_p95). These are defined and gated but have no rows.
- Competitor comparisons for DAW/VJ tools (Ableton, Bitwig, TouchDesigner, Resolume, VCV, Max): none. Do not claim parity or superiority against them from this data.

## 7. Safe claims from this data

- Pitch accuracy on par with Vital and Serum 2; aliasing in the same range.
- Offline movie render far faster than Blender on the measured scenes (note: different renderers, so this is a throughput comparison, not an image-quality one) and tight A/V sync (<0.05 ms offset, 0 drift over 10 minutes).
- Cloth simulation and subdivision faster than Blender on the measured cases; instancing slower.
- Launches in about a third of a second on a base M2; 400-node patches load in 6 ms.
- 97.6% plugin compatibility on the test machine, zero unexplained host crashes.

# Appendix A — Raw B-suite baseline (`bench/baselines/m2-8gb.jsonl`)

One row per recorded run. Frame times in ms, callback load as % of the buffer period, RSS in MB. B2/B4 rows are the visual and 3D scenes at increasing scale; B5 rows are node-count scaling, stage costs, startup, load/save and undo; B6/B8 are canvas and media I/O runs. Some bench rows were recorded at earlier commits than the final release.

Notes on the raw rows:
- **B1 (heavy audio, 149 nodes):** four runs at different buffer sizes. The 64-frame run had 3 xruns (not a target); 256 frames had 0. Callback load p99 40.3–44.7%.
- **B5 startup:** 342 ms to first frame. **B5 audio alone:** callback load 1.1–2.7%, 0 xruns.
- **B5 node-count scaling:** frame p50 1.0 ms (empty) → 4.3 / 7.5 / 13.9 / 25.8 ms at 50 / 100 / 200 / 400 nodes; these runs render every node every frame, so they are a worst-case scaling probe, not the canvas-pan test (B6).
- **B3 live performance (72 nodes):** 0 xruns, callback load p99 22.5%, projector p99 17.64 ms.
- **B7 soak (72 nodes, 106,837 frames, about 30 minutes at 60 fps):** 0 xruns, callback load p99 22.9%, frame p99 26.6 ms. The scoreboard still lists the soak metrics as unmeasured because the RSS-growth and thermal rows were not ingested; the raw run is above.
- **B10 offline A/V sync:** two 900-frame renders, no live frame timing (offline).

# Appendix D — Additional competitor runs (2026-10-17, M2 8 GB)

Run today with the repo's own harnesses (`tools/re-survey/`). All are black-box, outside-in measurements on the same machine. Caveats first:
- Plugins run at their **default state**. A default that does nothing (Pro-Q 4 flat EQ, Pro-L 2 under threshold, Infinite Limiter) measures as identical to the dry rig, so only its CPU column means something. THD/alias columns on reverbs and delays measure the tail (marked *), not distortion.
- The effects and synth probes ran at the same time, so the CPU columns carry extra noise; the harness says to treat differences under about 1 ms/s as noise.
- Phase Plant and Twin 3 produced silence or unusable output at their default state with no patch loaded; they are not comparable and should be ignored.
- The app bench ran while a second Infinite instance (the Desktop test build) was open, so Infinite's idle CPU may be overstated.
- No Windows/Linux competitors; macOS versions only.

Readings:
- **Latency:** Infinite effects report 0 ms after compensation (see the scoreboard). ValhallaRoom reports 11.4 ms.
- **Reverb:** Infinite Reverb 8.8 ms/s CPU against Pro-R 2 25.6 and ValhallaRoom 20.5, with RT60 1.48 s against 2.19 and 1.86. The Infinite reverb adds +4.3 dB at 1 kHz and clips at defaults (peak +5.9 dBFS); Pro-R 2 is -1.3 dB and ValhallaRoom +0.3 dB. That level jump is the known `fx.insert_gain_db` exception on the scoreboard.
- **Delay:** Infinite Delay 2.2 ms/s vs ValhallaDelay 7.4; Infinite adds +3 dB at defaults (peak +1.7 dBFS), ValhallaDelay -0.2 dB.
- **Drive/saturation:** Infinite Drive THD -35 dB vs Saturn 2 -40.7 dB at -12 dBFS (both are deliberate distortion); Infinite Drive's high-frequency alias floor is cleaner (-89.1 vs -32.3 dB) but costs 19.9 ms/s against 5.9.
- **Modulation:** Infinite Chorus, Flanger and Phaser use more CPU than the Kilohearts equivalents (3.6/3.2/2.2 vs 0.03/0.1/1.0 ms/s). Infinite Chorus and Flanger are louder-than-input at defaults and clip; Kilohearts Flanger has a deep notch around 250 Hz in the sweep. These are not like-for-like patches.
- **Dynamics:** Infinite Dynamics 2.8 ms/s vs Pro-C 2 3.2; at default Pro-C 2 distorts more (THD -70.6 dB vs the rig floor) while Infinite Dynamics matches the dry floor.

Reading: Wavetable and Analog match Vital and Serum 2 on pitch (0.2 cents worst case) and aliasing (about -81 to -85 dB non-harmonic). Infinite's per-voice CPU: Wavetable 1.3, Oscillator 3.4, Analog 8.6 ms/s; Vital 2.4, Serum 2 4.0, Diva 22.6. Infinite's instruments respond to velocity (24 dB span), while Vital and Serum 2 ignore it at their default patches.

## D3 Whole-app footprint: launch, idle CPU, memory


| App | Window s (1st) | Window s (warm) | Idle CPU % mean / max | Memory MB (footprint) | Threads | Processes | Bundle MB |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ableton Live 12 Suite | 4.7 | 3.1 | 41.9 / 49 | 672 | 76 | 5 | 8021 |
| Bitwig Studio | 7.8 | 6.2 | 17.6 / 110 | 1392 | 127 | 4 | 874 |
| Logic Pro Creator Studio | 2.5 | 1.3 | 3.9 / 8 | 122 | 27 | 1 | 2194 |
| TouchDesigner | 4.2 | 2.5 | 49.8 / 57 | 1396 | 30 | 1 | 1707 |
| VCV Rack 2 Free | 1.9 | 0.8 | 521.7 / 609 | 264 | 15 | 1 | 42 |
| Blender | 3.5 | 2.7 | 2.8 / 4 | 696 | 33 | 1 | 879 |
| Vital | 3.2 | 1.4 | 0.4 / 1 | 248 | 11 | 1 | 24 |
| BespokeSynth | 6.8 | 2.1 | 26.2 / 31 | 1528 | 13 | 1 | 268 |
| Infinite | 2.8 | 1.4 | 14.5 / 19 | 237 | 18 | 1 | 45 |


Reading (idle, nothing loaded, 2 runs, 15 s idle window): Infinite opens a window in 2.8 s cold / 1.4 s warm, uses 237 MB and has the smallest bundle of the full workstations (45 MB, against 874 MB to 8 GB for DAWs and TouchDesigner). Memory is below Ableton (672 MB), Blender (696 MB), Bitwig (1.4 GB), TouchDesigner (1.4 GB) and BespokeSynth (1.5 GB); only Logic (122 MB) and the Vital plugin (248 MB, a single synth) are comparable or lower. **Infinite's idle CPU is 14.5% of a core, which is higher than Logic (3.9%), Blender (2.8%) and Vital (0.4%) and below Ableton (41.9%), TouchDesigner (49.8%) and VCV Rack (521.7%, it renders its audio engine continuously).** That idle figure is worth checking on a quiet machine, since it was measured next to a second Infinite instance.

## D4 Not run

- Audio-callback load at matched track counts in Ableton, Bitwig or Logic; real round-trip latency (needs BlackHole loopback); movie render speed and live visual frame times against TouchDesigner (needs a manual Textport step); stretch and bounce comparisons (need hand-bounced files from each DAW). These tools exist (`bounce_kit.py`, `stretch_kit.py`, `latency_probe.py`, `render_bench.py td`, `av_bench.py td`) but need manual steps in each app.
